_V1.51_
    * Fixed a problem with some languages not showing up in the dialog
    * Dialog now checks the length of the button before adding it, getting rid of a nasty error
    * Included the two text files that are autogenerated by *babel.php* so setup is quicker.
_V1.50_
    * Completely changed *babel.php* in order to better handle google's new translation page
    * Added the ability to cache translations on your server.
    * Added the */55 autotrans* command to take advantage of google's auto-translation option
    * Notecards for languages are no longer needed, they are dynamically created on the server (one time only)
    * URL is no longer in the Query script, but in a notecard named *URL*
    * The babel fish will no longer nag you every time you re-attach the HUD. If you need to change your native language, you can reset the hud with /55 reset
_V1.41_
    * Updated the Query script by removing useless function encode_string.  The limitation on length into *llEscapeURL* hasn't been imposed for quite some time.
    * Changed *babel.php* to handle non-western characters better.  Used proper UTF8 character set.  As a result, a lot of code was removed.  URL Fopen also works as it should.
    * Added the */55 reset* command
    * Shiny new logo :)
_V1.40_
    * Updated the *babel.php* file: Added support for ignoring text during translation. Now any text that appears between two pipes (eg: |this| ) will not be translated.
    * Babel Fish now tells you when there has been a server-related error, instead of blindly saying HTML Error pages in chat.
    * Fixed a bug where people that, when asking for a language, it would time people out even if they responded and were added to the your list.
    * Removed the multiple listens, opting instead for 1 listen on channel 0.
    * Human-Readable commands! No more spk,tr,ra,?,rm .  Check the readme for more info.
_V1.31_
    * Updated the *babel.php* file. It appears Google has slightly different HTML than before.
_V1.3_
    * Extracted all the HTTP Request and query into its own script
    * Fixed an annoying bug where auto translate announced someone as speaking your language over and over again.
    * Removed esoteric function m2u since all the other commands are very intuitive and this one is an odd ball. Also freed up a lot of memory in the core script.
    * Combined a few lists into one stride list to avoid another list overhead.
    * Removed the langpair list from the php script since it is mostly inaccurate anyway.
_V1.22_
    * Bug with ask dialog, didn't ask the right person.
    * Small update fixes a bug with a few chat commands
    * Fixed the php script so it properly encodes into other character sets.
    * Fixed a bug with dialog pages not flipping.
    * Added new command for translating your own dialog into another language.
    * Fixed a bug when adding translations, would only translate from English instead of using your native language.

_V1.2_
    * New script that handles the language dialogs separately.
    * Added file_get_contents support on the php script. (Enable libcurl with the php define at the top)
    * Fixed a few more bugs
    * Fixed reliability Issues
    * Note: I found out that high-traffic may block the php from working. (Google's bot protection) So try not to publicly host your php files, or if you do, try using lib_curl through a series of rotating proxies. I do not encourage anyone to use the php script other than for their own personal translations.

_V1.1_
    * Fixed a few bugs (Moderate and Show-stopper)
    * Added rate limiting. Translations only happen once per second to avoid the rate limit on HTTP requests. The translation requests queue up if they happen more than 1/sec. This is good for crowds and ensures translations still happen in the order they come in.
