#summary Linked Message Protocol
#labels Project-LPAL,Phase-Design

= Introduction =

The following are the link messages that are used throughout the LPAL setup and playback process.  You may take advantage of this in order to create custom scripts that use some of the LPAL scripts.


= Protocol =

  * Assume link_message( integer send_number , integer NUM , string STRING , key ID )
  * Protocol is grouped by ID. Each message is under the ID name
  * Values in *bold* are fill-ins.
  * Blank values are unused

|| *ID* || *STRING* || *NUM* ||Description||
||_loader_||*SCRIPT_NAME*||*LINK_NUM*||Tells SCRIPT_NAME (which is a recording modules) to load itself into LINK_NUM||
