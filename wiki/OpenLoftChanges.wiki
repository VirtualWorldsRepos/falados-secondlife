 * Added Sculpt Preview
    This object allows you to view and save your sculpty in-world without the assistance of a webserver
    Rez the object next to your completed sculpture, press the green button at the top. 
    Now when you press RENDER, the sculpt preview object will draw the texture on the surface.
    To save this texture, simply sit on the orb and configure your SNAPSHOP window.
    You save this texture to your harddrive and play with it outside of SL, or upload it right away for 10L
